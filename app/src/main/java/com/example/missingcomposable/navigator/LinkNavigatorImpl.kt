     * constructed.
     * Intents that include a [data Uri][Intent.getData]. This Uri will be checked
     * against the Uri patterns in the [NavDeepLinks][NavDeepLink] added via
     * [NavDestination.addDeepLink].
     *
     * The [navigation graph][graph] should be set before calling this method.
